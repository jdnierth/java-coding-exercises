# Bank Account
* Create a new `class` for a bank account
* Create fields for the `account number`, `balance`, `customer name`, `email` and `phone number`.
* Create `getters` and `setters` for each field
* Create 2 additional methods
1. To allow the customer to deposit funds (this should increment the balance field)
2. To allow the customer to withdraw funds. This should deduct from the balance field, but not allow the withdrawal to complete if there are insufficient funds.
