#Equality Printer
* Write a method `printEqual` with 3 parameters of type `int`
* The method should return `void`
* If one of the parameters is less than `0`, print text `Invalid Value`
* If all numbers are equal print text `All numbers are equal`
* If all numbers are different print text `All numbers are different`
`* Otherwise, print `Neither all are equal or different`
  
#Examples
* printEqual(1,1,1) should print text `All numbers are equal`
* printEqual(1,1,2) should print text `Neither all are euqal or different`
* printEqual(-1,-1,-1) should print text `Invalid Value`
* printEqual(1,2,3) should print text `All numbers are different`

#Tips
* The solution will not be accepted if there are extra spaces.
* The method `printEqual` needs to be defined as public static
* Do not add the `main` method to solution code
