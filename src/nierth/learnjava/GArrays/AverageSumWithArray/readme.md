# Sorting `array`
* Create a program using `array`s that sorts a list of integers in descending order
* Descending order is highest value to lowest
* Set up the program so that the numbers to sort are read in from the keyboard
* Implement the following methods - `getIntegers`, print`array`, and `sortIntegers`
* `getIntegers` returns an `array` of entered integers from keyboard
* `printArray` prints out the contents of the `array`
* `sortIntegers` should sort the `array` and return a new `array` containing the sorted numbers
* you will have to figure out how to copy the `array` elements from the passed `array` into a new
* `array` and sort them and return the new sorted `array`
