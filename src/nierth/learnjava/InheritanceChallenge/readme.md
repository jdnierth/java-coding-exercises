# Inheritance Challenge
* Start with a base class of `Vehicle`
* Then create a `Car` class that inherits from this base class
* Finally, create another class, a specific type of `Car` that inherits from the `Car` class
* You should be able to hand steering, changing gears, and moving (speed in other words)
* As mentioned above, changing gears, increasing/decreasing speed should be included
* For your specific type of vehicle you will want to add something specific for that type of `Car`
