# Minimum And Maximum Challenge
* Read the numbers from the console entered by the user
* Print the minimum and maximum the user has entered
* Before the user enters the number, print the message `Enter number:`
* If the user enters an invalid number, break out of the loop and print the minimum and maximum number

# Tip
* Use an endless `while` loop
